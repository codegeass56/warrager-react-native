## What I learned
This project was my first exposure to building a cross-platform application using React Native with Expo. It allowed me to apply my skills in React to build a full-featured and user-facing mobile application. In addition, I had to overcome a number of key challenges, including:
- **State management**: I learned to manage complex application state to ensure data consistency across multiple components.
- **Database integration**: This project provided hands-on experience with asynchronous data handling and CRUD operations using Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Dependency management**: I navigated library conflicts and learned to integrate popular third-party packages, ensuring robustness and a consistent user experience.
- **Clean code and architecture**: This project was an initial foray into building a scalable application. This helped me understand the importance of clear folder structures and maintainable code.
- **Using TypeScript with React**: I had to learn to establish clear and consistent typing across components throughout the project.
- **Importance of reusability**: This application served as a launchpad to develop applications where I have been able to reuse form components from this project. This has taught me the importance and scalability of reusable components.
